# university-exchange-forum (backend)

## Why?
A platform to enable free and public exchange of information for student sub-communities from a certain institution/school. 
In some universities, websites like Reddit and a lot of other online forums are usually off-limits for posting information and talking about matters concerning the university (Both academic and informal). This platform aims to serve as a means to overcome that issue. Moreover, it allows for a more personalized experience by having questions/answers/threads that are more relevant to where you study.
It currently supports:
- "Like" and "Dislike" Button
- "Comments/Remarks"
- User profiles
- Creation of posts
- Sections to discuss subtopics 

#### Built using Spring Boot.
