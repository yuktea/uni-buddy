# university-exchange-forum (backend)

## Why?
In universities, websites like Reddit and a lot of other online forums are usually off-limits for posting information and talking about matters concerning the university (Both academic and informal). This platform is intended to be used for interations within the student community. 
It currently supports:
- "Like" and "Dislike" Button
- "Comments/Remarks"
- User profiles
- Creation of posts
- Sections to discuss subtopics 

#### Built using Spring Boot.
